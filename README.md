# learning_flutter1_part1

This project was created to teach my kids some basic coding skills, I picked Flutter/Dart because
I know nothing about it and thought it might be interesting for me and my kids to learn something
new together. Lessons start with a dart introduction in lib/dart_basics and are meant to be
done sequentially with someone guiding the neophytes. I might add more lessons in the
future if time permits.

## Getting Started

Start Android Studio and open each lessons in lib/dart_basics, start with 001_helloworld.dart, read the theory, do the
lab, try not to cheat and go at the end of the file to see the lab solution!
